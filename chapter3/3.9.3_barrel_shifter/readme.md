#### Operation of the testing circuit

The switches 7 to 0 control the input of the barrel shifter. 

The right (`btn[0]` shifts 1 bit right), center (`btn[1]` shifts 2 bits right) and left (`btn[2]` shifts 4 bits right) pushbuttons control the amount to shift and can be used together.  

The result is represented on the LEDs 7 to 0.
